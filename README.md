# House Price Prediction Model

## Project Summary
This project focuses on creating a predictive model to estimate house prices using various features, including square footage, number of bedrooms, and geographical location. The goal is to utilize data science techniques to deliver accurate price forecasts.

## Goals
- To build a predictive model using regression analysis for house price estimation.
- To explore the dataset for insights and trends related to housing prices.
- To assess model effectiveness through various statistical metrics.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Link**: [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## Project Steps

1. **Dataset Acquisition**
   - Obtain the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.

2. **Data Importation**
   - Load the data using the Pandas library.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Address any missing values and outliers.
   - Scale and normalize features to ensure uniformity.
   - Perform feature engineering to extract new relevant features.

4. **Model Creation**
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets.
   - Create a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
   - Train the model with the training data and generate predictions on the test set.

5. **Model Assessment**
   - Evaluate model performance using:
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - RÂ² Score
   - Generate visualizations to compare predicted values against actual prices.

6. **Reporting Results**
   - Document the analysis, findings, and model outcomes in a Jupyter Notebook or a formal report.

## Required Libraries
